Official Apology to Khan Leksei

Most gracious Khan Leksei,

With the utmost respect and sincere regret, we extend our formal apology for the inappropriate remark that unjustly questioned Your appearance and dignity.
The words spoken, which insulted Your name, were uttered thoughtlessly and do not reflect the honor You deserve, nor the truth â€” so evident to all who have the privilege of gazing upon Your radiant visage.

We deeply regret the incident and fully acknowledge the offense it has caused. We humbly ask for Your forgiveness for such recklessness, unworthy in dealings with a ruler as wise and noble as Yourself.

May peace, glory, and the undeniable beauty of Your greatness always remain with You ok.
